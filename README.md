Pictured above is the evaluation of the model before and after the optimizations. After the optimizations, the accuracy was able to improve to 1 and the loss decreased.

# Summary
The optimizations were able to create a more accurate model. The optimization that was conducted was primarily the adjustment of the number of neurons within the hidden layer. However, the main concern for this might be that the model itself is overfitted to the dataset. Therefore, additional testing may be necessary in order to make a proper model and verify it's reliability. Additional types of methods may be employed in this classification problem. The random forest model can be employed in which it tests many weaker models to create the needed analysis. This model is supervised as well and can be examined to ensure no overfitting occurs. Additionally, testing should be conducted with other datasets to ensure model efficacy.
